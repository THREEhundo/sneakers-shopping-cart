#### Libraries, Extensions, & Tools

- ReactJS
- React Router
- React Spring
- Tailwind CSS

#### Optimizations

- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header bug needs to be fixed. 
- API needs to be switched to one that doesn't charge per request.

#### Lessons Learned

- The value of having utility classes for CSS. Creating arbitrary class names were a headache for me. Using TailwindCSS allows me to just code out what I want the app to look like and not think about naming a variable of a box.
